title: "Another Vols Loss"
---

Another Saturday and it's another Vols loss, however, this was a major morale victory. We actually played really well. We actually led Georgia during the first
quarter, Neyland was actually loud and fun, it wasn't mopey! It was fun again! The Pride of the Southland Marching band then did the very impressive
Circle Drill which is very much a treat to see! However, after the half, we kinda collapsed, our offense couldn't make any gains. We kept getting stopped way too early,
wearing out our defense. Things just collapsed and we decided to leave before the start of the fourth. Any optimism we had was demolished again.

I've decided I can't keep wasting my time with things and I'm not going to anymore football games except for homecoming. It's too much to get hyped up and
thing we could beat anymore teams this year. This is going to be the worst season in school history but hopefully we have a great new quarterback who can make a difference.
Hopefully next year will be our year. I really wish my last year would have been a great football year, it would have been a great send off for my senior year.

Go Vols.
