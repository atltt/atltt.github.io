title: "Ukraine: Day Four"

Another day in Kyiv! This day we trecked out to the Chernobyl Museum! Along the way we stopped
at the Friendship of Nations Arch which was a quaint little park. Next to the Arch, there were all
these carnival rides. The rides looked decent but there was no one partaking. We walked up into
another park that was huge and really nice. There was this impressive statue to Prince Volodymyr the
Great. We then walked and got lost and ended up at St. Aleksander Church was a much more
modest Catholic church hidden away. We were looking for a different church and we walked back
into the park. Eventually we reached St. Micheal's famous golden domed & rebuilt church. This
church, although rebuilt, still looked very impressive. We went back in the park and got lost yet
again but we finally found the road we needed to take. We took this road and tried to look for
Google Ukraine, which was on the same street, but we could not find it. We then went to the
Chernobyl Museum which was one of the best museums I have ever been to. It was fantastic and
had artifacts from pretty much everyone involved. They had these huge maps and models to show
how big this disaster was. I didn't think photography was allowed so I didn't take any pictures which
is very disappointing.

The trip to Chernobyl is tomorrow and I am really excited to go!
