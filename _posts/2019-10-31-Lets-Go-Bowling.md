First off! Happy Halloween! I hope it's a spooky as you hoped for. My Halloween at the moment sucks. My power went off at 12:30 PM
from a very wimpy storm and it has still not come back on yet. This storm was supposed to be bad, it was light rain and some wind. Not enough
to instantly knock off my power, not for this long. KUB is running around fixing other customers that have larger outage areas, I understand
all that but it is still annoying that a small tree just fell and knocked it over. That's right a small tree, when I was leaving for my class, I saw
this small, twig tree laying across the road with the power line under it. That's cool I guess, I didn't want power anyways.

I'm writing this during this three hour class, it's nice since I can't slack off and just watch South Park like I normally do. I can do some sort of productive things.
Like write this blog, create a Google Maps Map of places to visit in Colorado, and work on Political Science homework. If I didn't get a scholarship for this minor, I would never
ever ever take these damn Industrial Engineering classes. They are so long and so irrelevant to my major and my career goals. I hate it so much.

Anyways, enough ranting. After the Vols' glorious win over the South Carolina Cocks I think we are able to win out this year. We are going against teams with losing streaks to but we have a great chance to do it.
The major issues are going to be UAB and Mizzou. People are saying Mizzou are the 3rd best SEC team this year but they haven't really played anyone. Mizzou will hopefully be like Auburn last year and we pull a surprise win over them.
This win would be huge and we would be able to win out easily from their. UAB is also a decent team with a lot of momentum this season. They should be a walk in the park like Georgia State but looked what happened with them.
I think Pruitt is properly coaching these guys to make sure they do not take anyone lightly. I really hope things will work out well, I would love to go to a bowl game in my senior year.
They're projecting us to go to the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, FL. That would be absolutely perfect and so much fun. If things work out, I'll share you what the plan is.
Until then, let's hope them Vols give em hell and we go bowling!
