title: "New Job This Summer
---

Last October, I secured a summer internship with Raytheon IIS in Dulles, Virginia. I have been trying to break into the defense
industry for the longest time now, from countless rejections from the other top contractors, even some rejections from Raytheon
I was beyond estatic when I was offered an interview. During the interview, I thought that I had messed up several times during it
and screwed myself out of it. Two weeks later, I recieved an offer from them. I was in total shock. I really couldn't even believe it
until I walked through those doors.

It was a long wait until May 2019, when I started. I spent a lot of time looking for housing, researching commutes, and things to
do and see in the DMV region. On May 17th, I had my last day with Dura-Line. On May 19th, I drove up to Fairfax to my airBnB. 
Along the way, I stopped at the National D-Day Memorial and it was quite the monument. The huge Overlord arch and the reflecting 
pool/courtyard with all the names of who perished on the largest naval landing of all history. It was beyond humbling and it relfected
back to me that I would be working on a project that would hopefully prevent another D-Day from happening, where our soldiers don't 
have to be on the front line to fight our nation's battles. I missed out on the L-3 plane they had on exhibit, it was shipped off to 
Liberty University for repairs before the 75th Anniversary of D-Day. I think I might stop there again on my way back. 

Anyways, May 20th was my first day of work at Raytheon and it was fantastic. I have a great team, great manager, and a really interesting
project. I feel like I am a new hire for this team and not an intern doing his own thing off away in a corner. I am making changes that
will actually been seen with future releases of this software. I am really enjoying it so far.

I have a huge backlog of blogs of things I want to write, I will do most of them eventually, hopefully this summer.
