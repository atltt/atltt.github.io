title: Shuffling My Positions
---

With the decent sized drop on Friday and today on tech stocks I decided to shake up my portfolio.
(Also big thanks to Goldman Sachs for making it drop, real cool guys over there.) I sold my holdings
of FHLC and FMAT to buy more ITA and a new position, Walmart (WMT)! Walmart is a great
investment. They are trying to go toe to toe with Amazon. Free two day shipping on $35 orders.
Huge logistics network. They are still a place to run to the store if you need something right then
and there. Walmart and Home Depot are some of the few retailers that will survive this retail
apocalypse. When you need something right now, you will probably head to one of those two
stores.
