I wanted to give a little review of a book I read over the course of maybe three months. No time to read makes you a slow reader.

I read Sehrii Plokhy's book "The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine". I read Plokhy's other book, "The Last Empire", and enjoyed
it beyond measure. It was a great and informative read. I read this book and was kinda dissapointed. He is an Ukrainian by heart
and he really loves his country and that love defintely came into this book. It has this sense of being rose-tinted about Ukraine.
Her history is long and most of it has been under occupation. He tries to make it the best light possible and you can't really blame him
The history he tells works best as a summary and really requires a third party history to really counter his bias towards Ukraine. 

If you know nothing about Ukraine but would like to know more, I say you check out his book. Just know about his biased attitude
and keep an open mind about it all.
