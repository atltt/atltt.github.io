title: What a Semester
---
It's been a real long time since I last did this. The last one of these was all the way back in September. I'm finally getting
back into this now that this hell of a semester is finally over. 

Big news is: I passed! All my grades are up and they are all solid B's. All of my classes this semester were overshadowed by a
single one, COSC 360. 360 was something else. It starts with the language it's taught in, C. C is rough. We have been pampered by
C++ and all the items done for you. We don't have to make custom data structures or use Dr. Plank's weird libraries. Everything in
C++ is just so much easier, it was just annoying to have to take a huge step back and limit ourselves to these archaic functions. 
We did 2/7 labs based around depreciated system calls. The labs were very difficult without any sort of direction. When you have to 
pass 100/100 gradescripts that have to fashioned in a very specific way, make the instructions clear. I wasted so much time testing
what the output should look like or what functionality should be in my programs because the lab writeups just didn't have them. 
Another bad thing about this class was the lack of TAs. The same class next semester has 6 TAs, this semester only had 2. They 
were overworked and could not really help us out. I also worked during the TA office hours so I could barely reach them for help.
The professor also just stole all of Dr. Plank's notes, I don't know why he taught the class and not Dr. Plank. 
I am just so glad I got a B in the class, I was certain I was about to get a C or not even pass. I was so worried. It is such a 
weight off my shoulders to finally be done with it. 

The rest of classes were better. Stats was good. I know it and it was only introductionary statisitics so I did breeze through. 
CS340 was a pain. I hope to never use JS or TS every again. What stupid and frustrating languages. They were just so bad to learn
and my teammates didn't help out either. CS 312 is a joke. I don't know why this is taught at UTK. None of the knowledge I learned
there will be used outside of some random trivia question. One class I really enjoyed but I couldn't fully delve into was ECE 463. 
463 was an introduction to data centers and nearly all classes had a person from ORNL come in and talk about the different aspect
of the data center work they do. It was really interesting and we got lecture from a lot of interesting folks. We even went on a 
tour of ORNL too! I wish I could have done more for this class. I've been under such pressure from CS360 that this went straight
to the backburner. Not being able to do more for this class is defintely my biggest regret for the semester.

I was also on the job search for part time positions and internships so that added even more work and stressfulness to the sememster.
I lucked out on both! So more on that later!

From now on, I'm just doing 12 credit hour semesters. Classes took up way too much of my time and were just nonsense most of the time.
I hate being stressed out from school, it really gets you down some of time. Thank goodness that it's over!
