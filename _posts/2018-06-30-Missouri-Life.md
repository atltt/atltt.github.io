Man living out here has been a lot of fun so far. I've been to two Cardinals games, two team outings, and I even drove into East St. Louis.
I've been learning more and more about the tragic history of St. Louis and just it's fall from grace. I'll write more about that at a later date.
I had no idea St. Louis County has a population of 1 million souls. Just wow!

One thing I learned working 9-5 is how little time is left in the day once you leave work. I get home just around 5 PM and usually I then go ahead
and make myself food and then the time is usually 6 and I have no idea what to do. There's just no time anymore. I'm just exhausted and I barely find the time
to do simple things. It's odd. I've been trying to change that by going out more. 

I love all the parks out here and all the events that go on. They're mostly all free and just a ton of fun. 

Driving is huge, everything is decentralized and there are highways linking everything. Driving in the big city sucks and St. Louis is no different.
They have five lanes of highways but people occupy all of them. They all go varying speeds, people going 80 in the right lane and then 60 in the middle left ones.
It's annoying and I wish people would just stay right. It's a total mess but it's like that everywhere.
