title: Recap of Last Semester
---

Last semester was a doozy! I switched from EE to CS. I dropped the required Physics and went down to four classes. I had Circuits 1,
Intro to Digital Logic, Differential Equations, and Data Structures and Algorithms. I really enjoyed Data Structures and Algorithms and
Differential Equations. I struggled in the other two since I just had no reason really to work on it since EE wasn't my major anymore.

I did fairly well in the classes but goodness I am glad I am done with that semester. I felt pretty stagnant that semester. This semester is
already way better. I am in Calculus 3, Matrix Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms II, Technical Writing, and Discrete Structures. 
The only class I'm annoyed at is Technical Writing since English is always the hardest subject for me. Anyways, I'm keeping busy and found
the time to write this little blogpost.
