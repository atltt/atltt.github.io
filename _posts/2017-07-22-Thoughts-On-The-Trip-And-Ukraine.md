title: Thoughts On The Trip and Ukraine
---

I gotta say. I enjoyed the trip. It was really fun to go to such a different country and just live life
there even though it was for a few days. If I had to go again, I would definitely make it longer so I
could go see Lviv and the Strategic Missile Forces Museum and go on an even longer Chernobyl
Trip. I also want to see Odessa and the Black Sea, it looks lovely.
I think it is really interesting to see the Euromaidan's revolution in footage and pictures and to know
that I was there too. It is crazy how much it changes in three years. I think everyone needs to see
Netflix's Winter on Fire, it is the best documentary on the revolution.
On Ukraine. Ukraine is still a developing country and it definitely shows. The gap between the rich
and poor is pretty outstanding. It was hard to tell being in the city center of Maidan but once you
left the city, it look exactly like poor Soviet landscape we hear about. The sheer difference in cars is
huge too. The amount of Range Rovers, MB, AMG, and all that was really jarrring seeing them next
to Ladas with CCCP country of origin. Like any city, the streets had beggars and street vendors and
all the sort. What really surprised me was the amount of vendors. They all seemed to sell the same
things and most of these shops were totally empty. The shop keeps were just reading or doing
something to pass the time. I really hated seeing all those people in the shops and on the streets with
zero customers. It saddens me no matter where I go, it's just hard to see.
Ukraine still needs to work on a to of stuff. They still have to deal with the Chernobyl Clean-up
which is a massive drain on their economy. They need to fix their tap water situation. That is
something I did not see happening in Europe, it was a wake up call. Although we didn't experience
it, they have a massive corruption problem. Any country with such deep corruption needs time to
heal but Ukraine just had the Euromaidan and needs to rapidly erase it. Along with the corruption, politicians need to be people that actually care for Ukraine and not interested in lining their pockets.
Ukraine has such a low birth rate and a massive brain drain to the West. These need to be stopped
fixed at once if Ukraine wants to be able to have a growing and secure economy. Most of all Ukraine
needs to secure the East and join the EU.
Although it's the capital and it is after the Euromaidan, Ukrainians seem extremely patriotic. People
wore the colors and the trident all the time. Cars had small flags on their dashboards. Flags were
everywhere.
Ukraine is in just such a tough spot. They have been subject gated for centuries under the worst
rulers imaginable. They have experienced terrible crimes by their masters and they want an
independent and peaceful nation. They are fighting a terrible civil war funded by their spiteful
Russian neighbors. They just had a huge part of their country illegally annexed by those spiteful
neighbors just for the fun of it. No one wants to risk a war over them either. The EU doesn't.
NATO doesn't. It is just such a bad spot that only Ukrainians themselves can work it through. They
barely receive any aide for all the bad things that go on. It won't be a short or easy road but I wish
Ukraine the best on it. They deserve it.
Sidenote, I knew Ukraine was a flat country but I had no idea how flat it really was. It's just so even!
It's like Indiana was Slavic!
