title: "Raytheon Internship"
---

So over the summer of 2019, I completed a 12 week internship with Raytheon IIS in Dulles, Virginia. I totally loved my internship. I worked on a
really interesting project, part of the modernization program for the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone. There was so much great things about it. The culture was great, 
my coworkers were so very helpful, my fellow interns became great friends. Raytheon was a really fantastic experience. It taught me a lot about new technologies and the projects
that Raytheon works on. It also helped me fall in love with the defense industry. The culture in this industry is fantastic. I've always found it hard to describe something good, it's so much easier
to rant about how much you didn't like something.

So I'll rant.

I absolutely did not like Northern Virginia, well really, the DC Metro Area. There was so much traffic during all hours of the day. Trying to do anything added a minimum of 30 minutes just to drive there. Everything was 
very expensive too, way about Knoxville and St. Louis prices I've come to know. Rents were sky high for a generic townhouse with the same features as all the 
other townhouses right down the street. It felt as nothing had no soul, no culture. When I was driving up to and away from NoVa, I saw the Virginia I loved. Small 
Southern towns with great hospitality and history. Once I got up into the Metro area, everything just felt like the same old suburb. No one cares about Virginia or her history,
they're just here to work. That really bummed me out, Northern Virginia has such an interesting history but I felt like no one cared for it. I can definitely say
Knoxville and St. Louis has a lot of pride in themselves, DMV (District, Maryland, Virginia) not so much. DC proper felt very prideful, past all the tourist traps.
I would be very interested in living there but traffic and rents makes that terrible decision. I do want to praise the DC Metro, the subway was a great way to get around
on the weekends to avoid trying to find parking and visit the sites.

I just think large cities are not my thing. I loved the size of St. Louis, I love Knoxville. When I visit Atlanta or Nashville, I just feel a bit anxious and overwhelmed. And I
feel the larger you go, the more commerical and soulless a place becomes.
