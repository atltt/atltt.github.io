title: Summer Classes Are Done!
---
I just sent off my transcripts from PSTCC to UTK. The two classes I took were Chemistry I and
English II. I got an A and a B in them respectively. I am officially done with my least favorite classes
ever. I dislike chemistry mainly for the fact that it is a tough class. It's a tough class that is completely
irrelevant to my degree, that's a big double whammy. I was fortunate enough to have an amazing
professor, named GD Pennycuff. He is a smart, funny, and caring man! Anyone not taking him is
making a mistake! As for English, I took it online so my instructor did nothing besides grading papers and taking forever to respond to emails. I weaseled by with a B which is surprising since she
gave me a C on every single paper I wrote in that class. I'm so glad to be done with English. I hate it
so much. I don't want to rant on for too long but it is a waste and a joke of a required class to take.
