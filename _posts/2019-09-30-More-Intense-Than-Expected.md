title: "More Intense Than Expected"
---

I always underestimate my classes and sure enough, I did it again.

My classes so far have been very all over the place. I dropped this Special Topics CS class since I realized that it would be a very boring
and not interesting class about Human-Computer Security. It's all just GUIs. I replaced it with an easy online Political Science class but it's mainly
just busy work.

This Intro to Cybersecurity class is not bad but the homeworks suck. She doesn't teach any bit of the homeworks so we are just thwon in finding these things out
totally by ourselves. That's not such a bad thing, but the problems are so far out in left field, it's a struggle to even find where to start with them. These homeworks
are 50% of our grade too, that's not a good combination. 

The History of Tennessee class I am taking is very interesting and it is one of my favorite classes ever. Tennessee didn't require a class on Tennessee history
like some states do, namely Texas, so it's great to learn about my favorite and home state of Tennessee. I really do have nothing but praise for this class. 
It is tough getting back to writing essays for classes like I did back in high school, but I can manage.

Senior Design is a bit of a joke. We keep getting guest lectures from people and topics that are on the very fringe of things we ever need to know. It's hard to wake up in the morning
to go to that class. We never know when attendance will be taken, so we can't really game the system. We've luckily found our project and a customer, so 
we can start working on all of this, so that's better than the rest of the curve.

My final and least favorite class is Intro to Reliability, an Industrial Engineering class. It is so hard. Not because the topics are tough, because it is so
irrelevant to my degree and my career goals. It is so difficult to pay attention for a three hour long class that will mean nothing to you once you get out of the 
final. It's requiring topics like statistics and integration which is ok, but I haven't used those things in over two years now and I don't want to re-learn everything
since I know I will never use it again. It really is a struggle with motivation for this thing. I wish there was someway I could get my minor with taking this class.
It would have been a million times better. It's also my most homework intensive class, which again, adds onto the hate for it. I cannot wait to pass this thing.

Here's looking to next year, when I am taking only 12 hours again with way more interesting classes that will actually be relevant to me one day.
