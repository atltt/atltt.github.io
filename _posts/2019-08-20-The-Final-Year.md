title: "The Final Year"
---

Tomorrow is the start for classes at UT. It's the start of my final year at UT, in college. It's a feeling I can't really place. I feel a bit
anxious feeling knowing that after this year. I will be a full fledged adult, my upbringing will finally be over. I've wanted this to happen for 
longest time now, but now that the deadline is quickly approaching, I am realizing that I need to enjoy the last time I have left. I've already made
the decision to only work about 10 hours this semester, going in twice a week. I think this will really reduce a lot of stress I get having 
to commute so much during the week, between classes. I'm taking five classes but it's really only 4, one of them meets on Thursday and is very easy.
I hope that the other classes will be chill so I can work on other things outside of class. This semester has some major goals outside academics.
I am finally on the right track with eating correctly and working out correctly, once I am able to launch into the semester, I will be able to 
finally lose this last bit of fat on me and build more muscle. It's sad, this is something I should have done long ago. This is also the semester to find a
job. I'm firmly settled on the Aerospace and Defense Industry. I have a few things lined up already that should let me knock this goal out early.
I am also planning a trip via Route 66 to the Grand Canyon to do during Spring Break 2020.

There is very little rest this semester, I feel like I will be doing a lot of things in a very short amount of time. I hope I will find the time to update these blogs.
I'd also like to redesign this site, but I haven't found a design I love to replace it with. I think once I did finally update the design, I would blog more about it.
