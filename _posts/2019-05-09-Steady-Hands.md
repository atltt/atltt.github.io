I only like the irrational stock market when it's in my favor. 

A while ago, I decided to try out options on a few companies I had high expectations of
Visa ($V), Mastercard ($MA), General Electric ($GE) and Microsoft ($MSFT). I dumped in $700 and started making some decent gains.
A week ago I was up +$4,710 (+701%), did I sell and capture smart gains? No, I thought to myself these were long term calls and there is no way something terrible could end this
bull run!

Then Trump tweeted. Trump's tweets have always been a meme with how much they can fluctuate the market, it's funny. I fully supported this tweet, but it still pains me
to see the lost potential I had when I was at the top of the world. The damn Chinese pulled a total 180 on trade negiotiations and Trump is raising the
tariffs on them. Even though I have lost $3000 within a week, I still support this trade war, I just really wish the stock market wouldn't get so jumpy over something
nearly everyone realized would not go through. 

We are demanded a lot of Chinese concessions, aka forcing rules the rest of the world has been following and no more free passes for Chinese business practices. 
It's logical stuff that the Chinese are not special and should follow the rest of the world in practices established after World War 2. The Chinese are obviously not
going to let the US walk all over them and the US is definitely not going to back down. I expect this trade war troubles to last a much longer time with several
face-saving measures to stop this massive market sell-off. I did sell nearly all of my long-term calls (These are end of May, June btw) and go into similar strike price puts to begin offsetting
this huge loss. 

I realize a few things about this:

1. When the SP500 goes up 15% in 3 months, be careful with long term calls.
2. When trade deals talks are going well, expect the opposite in a week.
3. Maybe do an actual strategy instead of meme calls, a straddle would have saved me here honestly.
4. Pay attention, the biggest reason I didn't sell at the top was that I didn't notice until it had passed. I noticed the height of it at +650% and I said I wanted the +700%. I got greedy and boy did I pay the price.
