title: A Year in Review
---

It was a dark and rainy night when 2019 rang in. I took a look back and saw all that happened during that year.

In January 2018, I got back into Knoxville from the GSM after being stuck in ice near Asheville. I was so relieved to finally be home.
Later in the month, I got one of my favorite things ever: My road bike. The Giant Contend SL 2 Disc. The best thing since sliced bread. 
This is my first road bike and I wish I went for this bike sooner. It's been so much fun and just fantastic exercise. I wish I skipped getting
my other bike and went straight for the Contend. It's been byfar the best purchase I've made in 2018. 

Then I just went about my days. Going to class and such. I ended out the semester pretty well! Summa Cum Laude, not too bad. Then it was internship
time. I packed my car and left for St Louis at 2 AM. It was a decent drive in the flattest terrrain out there. I set up my apartment in St Charles 
and then got to work at Mastercard. I really enjoyed my time at Mastercard. I enjoyed my time in St Louis even more. St Louis is my target city after I
graduate from UT. Within my target city is my target company; Boeing. I don't really need to expand why I want to work for Boeing. It's Boeing afterall. 
I feel like it would be the best area for me to end up in. For several reasons. 

As I returned from the STL. I moved into my studio in the ol' Kristopher Building, it's really rough but boy do I love it. I also entered into my worst semester at UT. The classes were tough and overbearing. I was lucky enough to pass with all B's this time.
I also found a job at a local company called Dura-Line. Dura-Line is a very interesting company and I am very lucky to have found a position there. 
I am very glad they have kept me around for the spring of 2019 and the fall of 2019. That little middle gap is saved for an internship at Raytheon in 
Dulles, VA. 

Finally to round out the year, my family went out ot Crested Butte, CO to visit my sister. It really is God's country out there. It is totally unreal 
the beauty out there. We also went snowmobiling! I've never done that before and it was some really great stuff.

2018 had a lot of ups and downs, I still really enjoyed it and I doubt I would have done anything differently. Here's to 2019. It looks like it's 
going to be a good year.
