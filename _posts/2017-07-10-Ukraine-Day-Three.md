title: "Ukraine: Day Three"
---

Good day today. We tried out Ukrainian McDonald's. I had this weird burger on ciabatta bread. It
had cucumbers, tomatoes, and this good Ukrainian sauce. We walked to the Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, and Mariyinsky Palace, which is the home of the Ukrainian President. It's essentially the White House. We checked out the park next to the palace
and it was really nice. There was a fantastic overlook onto the rest of Kyiv on the other side of the
river. The park also had some statues of people I have no idea who they are so I need to research
them.

Another pitstop was the Perschesk Larva complex. This complex was huge. It was filled to the brim
with Eastern Orthodox churches and art and others. There is a cave network that we did not see
because we wanted to get to the Rodina Mat. We need to head back there on a later day. While
there, we went into a museum about Ukrainian drama and theater which is a topic I really do not
care about. However, we were the only ones there and the staff there tried to help us out and learn
the exhibits which was really nice of them. I really enjoyed it.

The goal for this journey was the Rodina Mat and the Great Patriotic War Museum. The park was
amazing. There were a lot more vehicles on display. Major highlights of the vehicles are the LendLease
Douglass C-47, mobile nuclear missile launcher, an armored train, and a river monitor. There
was this museum on foreign Soviet wars (Afghanistan) but the museum needed exacted change so we
couldn't get in.

The Great Patriotic War Museum main center was directly under the Rodina Mat. This museum
mainly showed the role Ukraine had in the war. It showed me that they played a huge part of the
war. They supplied food and soldiers and industry while at the same time having their land being
fought over the two powers and the people being exploited on both sides of the front. It was rough
for them. They had a ton of artifacts in them but none of the explanations next to the artifacts were
in English so you can only glance and move on really. It was still really nice though.

The Rodina Mat is this massive statue holding a sword and a shield with the emblelm on the
Hammer and Sickle on the shield. This was created to commemorate the retaking of Kyiv and
Ukraine back from the Germans. Besides being called "Rodina Mat', it is called the "Mother
Motherland" monument but Rodina Mat is much better. It is huge and really awe inspiring. We
bought tickets to go up inside the monument but the museum closed before we could go up.
For dinner we had some dinner at our Hotel. I really liked it. It was really fancy and that fancy-ness
is really cool. Our hotel is really underrated. It is so nice and clean and offers so many professional
services. It's practically a great five star American hotel but in Kyiv and thus really cheap. You just
can't beat it.
