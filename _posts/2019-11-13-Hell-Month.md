title: "Hell Month"
---

November is quickly turning into a hell month. I have a research project due next week, a massive computer science project due at the beginning for 
December, and a too many homeworks scattered in all of this. Not to mention that my finals are also right at the beginning of December and I definitely need to study for those.
There's way too much to do and definitely not enough time to do all of it. I've had enough of school at this point I would love for it to be over already.
It's like the final mission in Halo: Reach, Survive.
