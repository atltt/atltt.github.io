title: Taleo Sucks
---

To any hiring managers reading this; Taleo sucks. It's internship application season and I've submitted a lot of applications. Too many companies
use Taleo for their careers section. Stop. Everything in Taleo is just so clunky and frustrating. Tons of items can be edited done to a single
click of a button instead of the three it takes now. The parser is stupid and makes countless mistakes. It doesn't save anything and causes tons 
of errors when reloading by mistake or accident. Also! Who still uses usernames these days? Just tie it to an email! In this day and age, all usernames
should be the email. And one more thing, the interface is garbage. It's ugly and just adds on to the frustration. Workday is so far the best I've 
used so far and I cannot see why more don't use it.

Taleo sucks.
