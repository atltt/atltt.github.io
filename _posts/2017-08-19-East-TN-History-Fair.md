title: East Tennessee History Fair
---

Today I went to the History Fair with my Mom and Dad. This was the first time I've been to it and
I gotta wonder why I never went before! It was a lot of fun! A ton of groups came out and brought
out artifacts of Tennessee history! There was a dog dress up contest and the dogs were absolutely
adorable! There was Elvis, Popcorn Sutton, a Rough Rider, a pilgrim, a Cherokee woman and a few
others. The Farmer's Market was also around and they had a ton of great items for sale. We went to
the Blount Mansion and Jame's White Fort which is always fun to see. It's crazy to think those
buildings are over 200 years old. We had lunch at Balter Beerworks and then headed to the main
museum. The museum is just fantastic and I recommend it to everyone. We then went to the
Phoenix Pharmacy and had some good but expensive ice cream. Over all, it was a great day with the
family!
