title: Changing my Major
---

Over the weekend I decided to do what a lot of EEs do and make the switch to Computer Science. I
kinda figured I would do something similar to this since I find the whole computer science parts
much more interesting than hardware. I'm a bit behind and this whole semester is a bit of a waste
thanks to me switching but it's ok! I'll still be fine!
