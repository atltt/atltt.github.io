title: "Final Season"
---

It's my final season as a student here at UT. It's been a turbulent couple of years. My first season was amazing, we honestly thought Butch was
going to carry us to Championship. He ended the 11 year Florida streak after all. Then 2017 happened, the worst football season in Tennessee history.
Then it was goodbye Butch, hello Hoke, hello coaching search, goodbye Currie, hello Phulmer, hello Pruitt. 

As I go into the first game of my last season, hopefully it will mean this season will be one of the best. We've had a really rough stretch since 1998.
Pruitt is a winner, he's been aggressive in his playstyle since the first game, I really do think we have a winner here. It'll be sad day when he leaves for
Alabama. Until then, thank goodness it's Football Time In Tennessee!

Go Vols!
