title: "New Plans"

Today was a great day! I went on a bike ride with my friend David and we eventually ended up at the Knoxville Downtown Airport. We were curious
and decided to check out the planes there. We walked around and gauked at all the cool planes. We eventually went up and said hello to this 
couple standing outside their airplane and we chatted them up. We expressed our interest in planes and flying and he went off. He started explaining
all sorts of things about flying. He talked about weight, flight details, weather, the process of becoming a pilot, and his experience. They
eventually decided to head off and we parted ways. He was just a great fellow to talk to. I was totally memorized by him and his cool stories.
This has really forced me onto a path on wanting to be a pilot. I've always wanted to but now it is set in stone. I don't plan to be a commerical
airline pilot or anything like that. I just want my private pilot license. I want to start right away but this college finances is just holding me back.
It looked like so much fun.
