title: "Ukraine: Day Two"
---

Second day in Ukraine! For future reference, I need to learn more of the language before I go. Or
maybe I need to go to a Latin language country, trying to decipher words is almost impossible.
There are hardly any sort of "matching" with English words. Knowing basic Ukrainian just doesn't
go as far as we like it to. There's also the point where you are on vacation and you don't want to put
in a ton of work to learn a language that you will probably never use again in the future.

We went to the State Aviation Museum next to the smaller Kyiv Airport. It was about $4 to get in
and another $3 to book tickets to view the cabins of the planes we could go inside. There are a ton
of planes there and I took over 600 photos while I was there. It was amazing and full of Soviet
aviation throughout the years. For the price, it was a total bargain.

For the rest of the day, we uploaded photos, which took forever of this hotel WiFi, and planned
where to go to get food. We were mainly trying to find places with an English speaking staff/menu
but it's kinda hard to come by. A lot of people online said we should go to Lviv if we want English
speaking but we just don't have the time to do that. We got properly soaked in a rain shower that
came right after dinner and we were quite the spectacle to all the Ukrainians who hid out under
porches away from the rain. All in all, it was a pretty decent day
