title: Back in The Scruffy City
---

I'm back in my dear ol' Knoxville, Tennessee! It feels great to be back! There's something about the mountains and all the trees that you really miss.
I was so giddy coming back and seeing those rolling hills all around me. It's just something about it that makes me love it so much. If
Country Roads had Tennessee instead of West Virginia, that song would be perfect. Speaking of West Virginia, can't wait for the Vols to be blown
out of the water by WVU in Charlotte. Seeing our scrimmage game, I just couldn't go to Charlotte anymore.

I also say I'm going to write a blog post but I never do! I live a fairly boring life but I am still trying to fix that. And if I fix that, I
can write more so the three people who read this can enjoy it more. I made the first deposit into my PPL fund a few days ago. I'm planning on saving
a cool 10k so I can get it all done in one quick sweep. I'm on the job hunt here very hard, I have a few promising things coming up but that's the thing,
it's coming up and you never know; with anything. 

Classes this semester seem very interesting. CS360 & CS340 look to be very challenging. I haven't programmed in a while so I am fairly rusty at it.
I'm also no the best ever at it either! Otherwise, my other classes seem fine! ECE463 looks extremely interesting! It's about data centers! Call
me a nerd, but I love those things. They are very cookie cutter in design and usage but they can be modified for the micro-improvments. We also
get to tour ORNL's data center and see Summit but I have a test the same day and I don't think I can make it. So that kinda sucks. 

I'm sending out internship applications for next summer! I really fell in love with St. Louis, for whatever reason, and I'd really like to go back there.
I'm hopeful that Mastercard will extend a return offer but I don't like putting all my eggs in a single basket. I'm really hoping for the big name in
St. Louis, Boeing. They do a lot of cool things out there. Applications have also been sent out to a slew of other companies, so we'll see how that goes.

I also just became Secretary of the IEEE branch at UT. That'll be fun! Really, I could not get into the Robotics Team. It seems like a part time
job for most of these people, that's unpaid. I enjoy programming but I don't enjoy it enough to go out of my way to do it. College is meant for 
fun activities not quasi-work. I think I'll try to start rock climbing this semester.


It's hard to think that two years ago I was just starting college. I never thought that I would have this awesome apartment, this massive set of 
skills and experience, and all the people I've met and befriended along the way. It really makes you realize what you have and what you've done 
as a person. God only knows where I'll be in two more years. I am a meticulous planner. Having this left to uncertainity really kills me. Not knowing
where I will be next summer stresses me out. I hope that'll be resolved soon. 

See you in a month! When I get around to writing another blog post!
