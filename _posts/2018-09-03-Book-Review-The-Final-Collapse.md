title: "Book Review: The Final Collapse"
---

I finished reading The Final Collapse last night and it is quite the book. It is written by General Cao Van Vien
, the former head of the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff. He writes from his own point-of-view of how South Vietnam whittled away
and finally collapsed. It starts with the end of US involvment and the constant amount of setbacks the South Vietnamese military suffered until 
Black April, 1975.

They lacked money, munitons, morale, fuel, and everything inbetween things that a proper army needed to function. From the initial probing attacks
of 1974, he detailed how US support was not coming back and they had to quickly rectify that situation. He went over how the terrible confusion
in MR-2 led to the total collapse of MR-1 and MR-2. After that, it was just a tidal wave of defeat after that. The heavy reliance on Regional 
and Popular Force units forced this sort of defeat much sooner. These milita units mostly evaporated at the first sign of enemy aggression and 
once those units evaporated, the normal ARVN had to be called in to defend these points. It is overstretched their lines and caused more issues 
on top of the hundreds of other issues they already had on their plate. 

This book is a very interesting and easy read. His writing is easy to read and you're able to understand everything that is going on. 

An interesting thing to note about this book. Published in 1983, he ends the book by talking about how the United States needs to up her efforts 
to halt the development of new Communist nations. He worried that soon it would just be the US and a few allies alone against a world of Communists. 
He worries about the end of the Free World. It's a very interesting look at the mindset of the 1980s.
