title: "Book Review: Destiny of the Republic"
---

I bought this book on a whim on Amazon and it turned out to be a good decision! The book follows the later part of President James Garfield's
life and his eventual assination. It follows a trifecta of characters, Garfield, Charles Guiteau, and Alexander Graham Bell. From what it seems
Garfield was set to be a great President. He was sorta independent from the deep factions in the Republican Party and had a great envisionment
to reform the US Civil Service. Those plans were stopped when Charles Guiteau shot Garfield in cold blood.

Guiteau was totally insane. He spent time in several communes, stole and borrowed money from everyone. He wrote a mediocre speech in favor of
James Garfield during his election and his craziness led him to believe that he deserved a post at the US Embassy in Vienna or Paris. He was a total nut.
He was ignored since he was just some common guy and this led him to think that Garfield was going to ruin the country. He thought he had a mission from
God to kill Garfield to save the US. Insanity. He even thought that General Sherman would lead a coup to save the US and he would be hailed
as a national hero. 

In all, it was a nice little read. This era of US History is often glanced over. Few people even know that four US Presidents were assassinated. 
If this interests you at all. Be sure to pick this book up.
