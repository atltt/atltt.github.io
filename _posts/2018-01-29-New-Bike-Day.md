title: New Bike Day
---

Today I got my new bike! It is a Giant Contend SL 2 Disc and oh my goodness is this bike amazing. I've been planning to get a proper road
bike eventually today I finally got it! I've been into cycling since picking up a Giant Escape 2 last year in May. I loved it right away but
I saw the limitations my bike had. I've been saving for a while and I went and took up two credit card bonuses (thank you US Bank) to go ahead
and purchase my bike from Harper's. 

I got some initally thoughts. First, this bike is so light! It feels like nothing at all. The shifters are built into the brakes and they are
amazing. They feel so fluid. And the biggest thing is that this bike is super quick. I feel like lighting. I know bikes can be fast but this is
 fast with not a whole lot of effort to make it that fast. 
 
 I cannot wait to take this guy out for a proper ride. I bought this at a conflicting time. The past couple days have been in the high 50s / 
 low 60s but this week it is supposed to drop back into the 30s. Not cool weather.
