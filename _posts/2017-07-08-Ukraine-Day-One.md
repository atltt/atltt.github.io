title: "Ukraine: Day One"
---

After a very long drive to Washington and after a very long wait at Dulles and after a long flight to
Frankfurt and after a long wait in Frankfurt and after a long flight to Kyiv we finally arrived.
Lufthansa is a really nice airline and I used a moist towelette for the first time ever. I watched a few
movies on the planes. I saw Get Out, Founder, and Logan. Logan seemed like a massive
advertisement for Chrysler. Founder seemed like a massive ad for McDonalds. We met this awesome
man who was revisiting Ukraine after leaving in 1990. He had some great stories about growing up
and his life and all that. 

The airport was very different. For such a major city in Ukraine, there were hardly any planes
leaving or taking off. The airport also seemed very emotionless, very Soviet. The drive over was only
about 30 minutes and those were some scary 30 minutes. The drivers here are mental.

We checked into the Hotel Ukraine and essentially collapsed from exhaustion. We woke up a few
hours later and checked out the Maidan. The Maidan is an awesome place. It is a very open and
modern space. It felt much more like a Western city rather than a very Soviet city. You can still see
the amount of Soviet influence but it has very much diminished. There was this small summer
festival and just a ton of live music. There was just so much. Kyiv is a really neat place.
