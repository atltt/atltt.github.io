title: New Apartment
---

I'm finally getting around to writing about
moving into my new apartment! This place is
really good! It's very spacious and the closest
space is great. It is always nice to have space and
not need it. I was worried about the carpet
since it's carpet but luckily it's not too bad. The
carpet isn't thick and it is brand new so I can
still get that new carpet smell. I got a really fast
plan with Comcast and it way more than I
need. My room is set up close to perfect. I want
to upgrade my nightstand to be something that
has a much darker wood look to it. It's so nice
being back downtown being able to bike and
walk to places. I especially love being able to
hop onto my bike then right onto the
greenways right outside. I like it here!
