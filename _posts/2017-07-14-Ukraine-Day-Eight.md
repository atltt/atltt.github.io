title: "Ukraine: Day Eight"

We went out to see the Golden Gate, which was an important access gate into Kyiv during the
Middle Ages. The Gate was mostly rebuilt except for the stone ways in the center. Next we went to
St. Volodymyr's Cathedral which we actually went inside. This place was nuts on the inside. It was
totally decorated in every nook and cranny. There were also a ton of people lighting candles and I
kinda wished we did that too. Next on we went to the Kyiv Fortress which was an old Imperial
Russian fort in the heart of Kyiv. This place was kinda run down. The barracks itself was fine but the
citadel and the grounds around it were unkept which was kinda sad. Inside the barracks, there was
this picture and art exhibition. The pictures were from the front lines out in eastern Ukraine. The
pictures were really good and showed how brutal the war over there is. The art there was modern or
something and I did not understand it. Once again, we were the only ones inside the exhibit which
is always discouraging. I hate when people have no customers or anything like that. The Kyiv
Fortress mixes into a hospital. This hospital was really quiet and peaceful. It didn't even look like a
hospital at all. It was a Saturday so there were not a ton of people walking around except for people
trying to get through it. We walked back to the hotel where we got some more chocolate from a
Roshen store and we got some Ukrainian gifts from a street vendor. That's essentially the gist of the
day and tomorrow is the last day of Ukraine. It's been fun!
