title: End Of My Internship
---

Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened.

So my internship at Mastercard is over. After ten weeks I've learned a load of new skills. I've met a lot of great people. I've made a 
lot of great friends! Big shoutout to my manager to Jake, who helped me every step of the way. Also big shout outs to my best friends at 
this internship, Ian, Payam, and Matt.

I've learned a lot about Splunk, .NET, Groovy, Jenkins, SonarQube, the SAFe Agile, and NUnit testing. I'm so glad I was thrusted into this role
so I could learn all these new skills. And these are really valuable skills. Software development is increasing going towards CI/CD and code
metrics and health and these are the best tools in the business. 

The Saint Louis Metro region has defied my expectations but I'll talk more about that later.

I really hope I can return to Mastercard for another internship. As soon as I get the call, I'm accepting it.
