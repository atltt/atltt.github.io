Day two of the Chernobyl Trip! We woke up at the hotel and headed down to eat some breakfast.
We had a pretty large meal and we moved out. We hit up this general store in Chernobyl. This
general store had a whole bunch of dogs hanging out of in front of the store. These dogs are just
hanging out and being rad. Our tour guide bought a whole loaf of bread to feed the dogs.

We then went to Pripyat and explored a lot of the town. The town is just so dead and completely
overgrown. Buildings just came out of no where from the forests. The streets are overgrown and are
just fighting to be seen. We went into a kindergarten and just so much of it was just left in ruins. You can see how much these people left behind. There are a lot of dolls purposely set up to be more
creepy which is kinda dumb but cool at the same time. We then saw all the main sights of Pripyat.
We saw the city center and hotel. We saw the abandoned ferris wheel and amusement park. We saw
the stadium and the palace of culture. We saw the sports complex and everything! This cat started
following us mid way through and eventually we lost sight of him. At the end of Pripyat we went
atop an apartment complex so we could see the scale of Pripyat. I snapped many pictures because it
was totally crazy up there. There were so many buildings over the forest.

Leaving Pripyat, we had lunch at the Chernobyl NPP canteen and had a plentiful meal. While
eating, it began to rain and we rushed to the van. We headed off to the cooling pond to see the
massive catfish living there. We then headed to the main site in front of Reactor No 4. It was raining
hard so we just ran out and grabbed a few pictures and hopped back onto the bus.

The rain cleared and we went to the Duga Radar station called Chernobyl-2. This radar installation
was absolutely massive. This place was just big and full of metal and wires. We explored around
more and went into the military base next to the station and explored around. While at this radar
station, we had a dog tag along and mess around with us trying to play.

Once done with the radar station, we headed back to Kyiv. At the final checkpoint, they somehow
lost electricity and could not run the radiation detection machines and just let us on our way. This
kinda showed the state of Ukraine really. We passed a lot of houses on the way back to Kyiv that
looked like they are inside the Exclusion Zone. There is a ton of poverty here. Ukraine is a
developing country still and this can be expected but it is still sad to see.
