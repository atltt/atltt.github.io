title: "HBO Chernobyl"

Ya know, I liked Chernobyl before it was cool.

HBO's Chernobyl was another great miniseries. In five episodes, HBO recreated 1986 Ukraine and the Soviet Union's many great qualities.
Secrecy, over-bearing politics, great Soviet engineering is all on display. It was dramaticized a bit, but that's just telivision. It really
fills you with the despair of the disaster. The explosion, the leadership incompetence, the long and dangerous cleanup, this show covers
nearly all of it. It always amazes me how they find actors that look like the people they portray, it's really striking with some of them.
I don't really have any major criticisms with the show, if you can, you should check it out.

I really enjoy how this has brought up to one the most interesting topics of history. I have always had a fascination with Chernobyl.
There's just something about the whole situation that is beyond interesting for me. Any source, any documentary I must see. I think I've
capped off my interest with Chernobyl by actually visiting Chernobyl. It was an amazing trip and I hope I can go back again one day.
