title: "Garth in Knoxville"
---

Over the weekend, I saw a once in a lifetime experience. I saw Garth Brooks in Neyland Stadium. Garth is one of most restrictive artists out there.
He only allows his music on Amazon Music, clamps down on YouTube uploads, and I honestly never hear his songs on the radio. I love a lot of his songs
but I am so used to other people sing his songs at this point. It was great to finally hear his songs in person and sung by him for once. It was a great concert
with one of the best venues out there. 84,000 people packed into Neyland to sing country, I love it. It's also the last time, that I know of, that I will be in Neyland
as a student. Things like this are finally wrapping up and it definitely makes me tear up just a little. I'm glad that my send off ending with Garth
singing Rocky Top with us all at the very end. I don't think I will ever forget this.
