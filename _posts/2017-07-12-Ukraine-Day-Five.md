Today is the day of the Chernobyl Trip. We rushed out early and uberd over to the meet up spot for
the tour. The tour guides took our money, set us up in the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans and off we
went. After the formalities, we watched this great Chernobyl documentary to pass the time while driving from Kyiv. Eventually we reached the border of the Exclusion Zone. There were a lot more

groups and we formed a line and slowly we went through the checkpoint.
After another drive we reached out first stop, the town of Chernobyl. This town is still in habituated
by alternating shifts of people. These people are completely cut off from the rest of the world due to
their work. We looked at the buildings in use and the abandoned sections of town. We then moved
on and stopped at a monument to the firefighters and liquidators. This monument was built by the
relatives and fellow firefighters for the one year anniversary.

The next stop on the tour was this village that I don't remember the name of. It was pretty far out of
the way, 40 minutes each way. However, this village was left relative intact and looters have not
totally ransacked the place which which was really interesting to see how these people lived in that
day and age. We saw many buildings like a church, a post office, and a ton of private houses.
Driving back, we stopped to see the robots used in the clean up operation.

Afterwards, we had to be checked for radiation at the inner Zone checkpoint but luckily no one had
anything on them. We moved onto this summer camp. This summer camp looked awesome. 1980s
coming of age movies dream about places like this; it was quiet, in the woods, and right next to the
water. The cabins were in disrepair and it was awesome to wander around. The Soviets had all these
knock off cartoons painted on some of the cabins making things pretty creepy.

We moved on to another village. This village was torn down and buried due to radiation amounts.
There were hotspots of radiation everywhere. We went into this kindergarten which was one of the
only buildings still standing. This place was very eerie. Dolls and empty cribs were everywhere.

The hotel we arrived at is in the town of Chernobyl. It was specially set up just for tourists like us.
The hotel is extremely nice but it does lack AC which is killer. This place also has a lot of faux
construction like fake columns and cheap wood floors to make it look high class. I still like it. I
think the best thing is is how I can hear the wild dogs howl right outside my window as I type this.
Pripyat, Duga 2, and the power plant are tomorrow.
