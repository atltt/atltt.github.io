title: Update so far
---

It has been rough the last couple of weeks! Tests, quizzes, labs, and rejection emails! Just so much has been going on
lately and I've been barely able to keep up. Things arre finally cooling off now and I'm able to post to my amazing blog
and update all the old blogs I've posted before. I'm still learning the site and I want to really make it unique to me and
be something I'm proud of. It's also Veteran's Day today and I'd like to remember the great sacrifice others have made for
all of us in the United States. It's incredibly humbling to think about. 

God Bless America.
