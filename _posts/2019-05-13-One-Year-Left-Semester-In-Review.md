title: "One Year Left, Semester in Review"
---

So after last semester's tough semester I decided to take only four classes: ECE 453, Computer Networks, COSC 361, Operating Systems, COSC 365 Survey of Progamming Languages,
 IE 484, Intro to Maintainability. I still worked nearly 20 hours at my job, which I still I still have not discussed on my blog. 
 
This semester was a decent one, this and the combination of work made things very stressful though, although not as bad as last semester. Three out of my four classes
tried to be the "commandeering" class of the semester, like how COSC 361 was the toughest and most time consuming class last semester. None of them really wanted to take back and realized that
they were an elective class and not make the workload so bad. 

It was not all bad, IE 484 allowed us to go out and tour a waste water facility at First Utility District of Knoxville. FUD was a really interesting place to see,
we all depend on the plants to clean our water and our environment but we often never think about them. It hardly occurs to me anymore that a KUB faclity is right on 
Neyland Greenway/Drive. Through the terrible smell, I did learn to stop using those flushable wipes. See, flushable does not mean it will actually break down and not clog
the waste water facility, it does the opposite. 

In all, I just wish classes would just calm down and know they are not the center of attention. I am beyond excited that there is only 2 semesters left, one year.
Finally I will be done with school, I have been tired of school since day one and I cannot wait to be done with it all. I want to make money, leave work at work, I just cannot
wait for that to happen. These last two semesters should not be too terrible but I keep hearing horror stories from senior design and bad teammates. I know I will get through it, 
but I wish I could just easily glide through it. I guess we will see!
