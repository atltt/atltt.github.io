Oh sweet goodness please let us beat BYU tonight. I don't think you could kill a football program better than losing to Georgia State and BYU in two weeks.
Morale in this team has been low for this team for so long now, more pathetic losses will just continue to lower it even more. I hope Pruitt finds 
the fire he had last seasons and shoves it to those Mormons. 

In other news, I dropped COSC 494 and replaced it with POLS 240. It became really clear to me that this CS class was just going to be a drag. It seemed to consist of nothing
but reading research papers about Human-Computer Interaction, essentially GUIs. Yawn. From my friends still in the class, it still seems to be going that way.
I replaced it with an all online political science class (score!). I just want to cruise in my last semester, for a reason I will share with you all later.

But today is Saturday and it's for the boys. 

Go Vols!
