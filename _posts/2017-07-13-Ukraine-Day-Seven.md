title: "Ukraine: Day Seven"
---

Today was a pretty chill and relaxed day. We grabbed breakfast and got a few pictures of the empty
Maidan. We ordered laundry service which was a total ripoff but what can you do? We then headed
off towards the Chernobyl Tour office to get some souvenirs. I got two t-shirts, a dosimeter pen, a
map of the Zone, and a gas mask! It was a great haul! We got the items and went back to the hotel.
We then headed out again and went to St. Sophia's Cathedral complex. This was very similar to
Perchesk Larva and honestly the main chapel of the two looked identical. We then headed to the
Natural History Museum of Ukraine. This museum was a very nice museum! This place was so nice
and totally packed with interesting exhibits all throughout Ukraine's history. They had all these great
little artifacts everywhere! From the ancient tribes to the Kyiven Rus to the Soviet Union to the
Euromaidan, this museum had it all. There was this exhibit about the money used in Ukraine and it
was really interesting. There were a ton of coins from the middle ages and all that. The really
interesting pieces were the ones like from the short lived Ukrainian People's Republic. Also the
German bank notes used during the occupation were cool to see. At the end of museum, there was a
special exposition on the Euromaidan which was really interesting. They had the riot shields and the
Euromaidan propaganda. They also had the piano played atop of the Maidan. This exhibit was just
really humbling to see. Afterwards, we went to a pizza place and got a pizza which had an Ukrainian
twist on it. It was good and the main differences was in how the meats where prepared. We headed
back to the hotel and relaxed for the rest of the day.
