title: "Ukraine: Day Nine"
---

Last day in Ukraine! We didn't do a whole lot to be honest. We spent most of the day at the parks
around and at Pechersk Lavra. The complex is a really nice place. It is so quiet and peaceful and all
the small paths lead back to each other which is awesome since you can't totally get lost. We wanted
to see the caves around the cathedrals but it turns out it requires a dress code and since I wore shorts,
I couldn't get in. It kinda sucks but to get back into the complex we would have to pay admission
again. The caves seemed neat but definitely not trip ruining. We also passed by the PRC embassy
which is right next to the Rada. I got my final t-shirt, a Ukrainian trident one. The others I have is a Chernobyl Tour shirt and a yellow UKRAINE shirt. The fabric on the one I got is not a cheap
cotton but it is some polyester material because it is so soft. We headed back in early today since we
have to get up super early to catch our flights. I'll include my thoughts on the trip and Ukraine in a
later blogpost.
