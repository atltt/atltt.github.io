title: "My Final Football Game"
---

Yesterday, November 2nd in the year of our Lord 2019, I attended my final football game as a student in Neyland Stadium. I won't be in town for
the final home game against Vanderbilt so this made the homecoming game my final game as well. It was a little sad. I took a lot of pictures of 
myself, Carli & I, and Caleb & I to remember this sort of thing. I also recorded the entire halftime show, which was really something else. Lee Greenwood
performed one of the best songs ever, "God Bless the USA", and it was really touching. It was a really good send off. The game was decent and we won again, thank
goodness, but it just lasted too long. It was way too cold for this nonsense that UAB did, they called two timeouts with 3 minutes left since they could
barely line up. Just end the game at this point, come on guys. Besides the cold weather, it was really great and I will remember it for a long time. 

This is one of the many things that I won't do again. I won't walk through the student gate, Gate 23, anymore. I won't be dissapointed getting bad seats
right in the middle of the student section and then moving mid-game. This football really just came and went. It feels like only yesterday when it started against
that cursed Georgia State team. This entire semester has been flying by and some of the things I do, realize or not, are the last things I will do
at UT. There will be a day when I never set foot inside Min Kao, Perkins, the Student Union, and all the other buildings on campus and when I think about that
it makes me long for those days again. I'm trying my best to capture the memories of these places and all that has came with them.
