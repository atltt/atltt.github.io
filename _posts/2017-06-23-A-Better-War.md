title: A Better War
---

Today I finished reading "A Better War" by Lewis Sorley. This books details the American
involvement in Vietnam post the 1968 Tet Offensive. Really, this book followed Creighton Abrams.
General Abrams totally changed how the US was fighting the Vietnam War. He went from
Westmoreland's conventional warfare strategy and instead focused on the village and the hamlet. He worked for better intelligence, he destroyed the Viet Cong infrastructure. With a swindling amount
of troops and resources, he still managed to make South Vietnam safe and secure. In 1972,
Americans could travel outside the major cities without a security detail, this is something that
wasn't achieved during all the years of the war. It really shows how much he was able to change it
all. However, we didn't stick to our promises and forced South Vietnam to sign a terribly unfair
Peace Accords. We didn't stick around to give aid and retaliation when the North Vietnamese broke
the Peace Accords. We betrayed them. It is a sad mark on our history.
